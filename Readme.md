I am [@unixfreaxjp](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp) and this is the front-end of my working space in the GitHub.

I am a security engineer, currently a cyber threat analyst and RE in IR field of cyber incident management. For coding, I am a practical UNIX related coder, I coded in some languages without flavors and I don't like to do specific indentation. My code environtment is on the shell, mostly on the `VT100`-base.

I do programming in: `Perl`, Shell scripts, `C`, `Python`, `Assembler` or a bit of `Ruby`, with some web programming like: `PHP`, Java(+/-JavaScript), and also some `VB/PowerShell` etc. Currently I'm on `LUA`, `Cython` and `Go` for DFIR/RE purpose.

My [PGP](https://keybase.io/unixfreaxjp#show-public):

Several on-going and done coding projects I do in GitHub are:
- [Glibcver-endian-checker](https://unixfreaxjp.github.io/glibcver-endian-checker/) (C)
- Doing research in *Linux interception* on: [kernel](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/dev/tree/master/kernel_interception), [network interface](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/dev/tree/master/network_interception) & [service request](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/dev/tree/master/request_interception). (C)
- [HostileBlocker](https://unixfreaxjp.github.io/HostileBlocker/) (bash)
- [MalwareMustDie Code Repository](https://unixfreaxjp.github.io/malwaremustdie/) (Various)
- [Blog Parser](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/unixfreaxjp.github.io/blob/master/scripts/arc_parser.js) (JS)
- [Shared some malware Yara rules](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/dev/blob/master/others/SharedYaraRules.md) (Yara)
- [Several RE related stuff](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/dev/blob/master/NixDFIR_ReverseEngineeringCodes/ReadMe.md) (Various)

And I write reports on cyber threats / RE / DFIR, with GitHub data as reference, in example:
- [Some shared monitoring reports about IoT botnets](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/malwaremustdie/blob/master/etc/IoT_Botnet_Monitoring_Report.md)
- [IOC repo and checker for Dyre Routers threat](http://unixfreaxjp.github.io/dyrerouters/ )
- [IOC repo for Strudel threat (SSH TCP Redirection Attack)](https://unixfreaxjp.github.io/Strudels_Attack/)
- [And these malware analysis reports](https://blog.malwaremustdie.org/)
- [Also some Japanese threat analysis](https://blog.0day.jp/)
- Also links from my Linux and `ELF` malicious binary research repository I've focused since 2010.

I am now a committer to issue bugfix, enhancements & tests to help radare2 improvement in UNIX systems:
- [Radare2 project for bug & enhanchment issues](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aall+unixfreaxjp+)(these are **"not easy"** stuff)
- [Radare2 project to test for embedded OS & BSD platforms](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/malwaremustdie/tree/master/radare2test)
- [Radare2 project to report recent STABLE, compatibility & supported UNIX servers OS](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/r2jp/blob/master/UNIXServerCompatibilityReportEN.md) 
- [My work on radare2 patches and workarounds](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/malwaremustdie/tree/master/radare2stuff)
