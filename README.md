I am [@unixfreaxjp](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp) and this is the front-end of my working space in the GitHub.

I am a security engineer, currently a cyber threat analyst and RE in IR field of cyber incident management. For coding, I am a practical UNIX related coder, I coded in some languages without flavors and I don't like to do specific indentation. My code environtment is on the shell, mostly on the VT100-base.

I do programming like in: Perl, Shell script, C, Python, Assembler or a bit of Ruby, with some web programming like: PHP, Java(+/-Script), etc.
Currently on LUA, Cython and Go for DFIR/RE purpose.

My [PGP](https://keybase.io/unixfreaxjp#show-public):

```
Several on-going and done coding projects I do in GitHub are:
- [Glibcver-endian-checker](https://unixfreaxjp.github.io/glibcver-endian-checker/) (C)
- Doing research in *Linux interception* on: [kernel](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/dev/tree/master/kernel_interception), [network interface](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/dev/tree/master/network_interception) & [service request](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/dev/tree/master/request_interception). (C)
- [HostileBlocker](https://unixfreaxjp.github.io/HostileBlocker/) (bash)
- [MalwareMustDie Code Repository](https://unixfreaxjp.github.io/malwaremustdie/) (Various)
- [Blog Parser](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/unixfreaxjp.github.io/blob/master/scripts/arc_parser.js) (JS)
- [Shared some malware Yara rules](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/dev/blob/master/others/myYaraRules.md) (Yara)
- [Several RE related stuff](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/dev/blob/master/NixDFIR_ReverseEngineeringCodes/ReadMe.md) (Various)

And I write reports on cyber threats / RE / DFIR, with GitHub data for the reference, in example:
- [Emerging IoT attacks of Kaiten-AK47](https://gist.github.com/unixfreaxjp/7b8bd6be614f7a051fc9a9da760d3138)
- [IOC repo and checker for Dyre Routers threat](http://unixfreaxjp.github.io/dyrerouters/ )
- [IOC repo for Strudel threat](https://unixfreaxjp.github.io/MMD-0062-2017/)
- [And these malware threat reports](https://blog.malwaremustdie.org/)
- [Sometimes several Japanese threat analysis](https://blog.0day.jp/)
- Also  links from my Linux and ELF malicious binary analysis research repository I've focused since 2010.

I am in a routine task to report these tests too, via Github to help dev team for compatibility check and bugs:
- [Radare2 tests for embeddedOS & BSD platform](https://github.com/unixfreaxjp/malwaremustdie/tree/master/radare2test)

You can contact me in the GitHub.
